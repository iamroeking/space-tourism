## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Tailwind
- DaisyUI

### What I learned
I enjoyed programming this site as it provides content on space tourism and has sections designated to explain further with stats on different destinations i.e the moon,mars, europa, and titan.

The Home page gives you a welcoming feeling into the exploration of space with a responsive background image which gives users a satisfing view depending on their device's screen size.
 
Developing this project expanded my knowledge on building multipage site as well as using flex to display contents in column and row the right way to enhance the user's experience with the site. I also was able to make use of JavaScript eventlistener to make the hamburger menu quite interactive.

I made the site responsive by using tailwind's media queries to display the flex contents which helps users view the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size

Finally, i learnt about installing DaisyUI which assisted me creating a carousel displayed on the crew's page faster.

### Continued development

In future projects, i will focus more on Javascript and React to enhance my skills in manipulating the DOM, i look forward to using more events as well as learning new concepts.
